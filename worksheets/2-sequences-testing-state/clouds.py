    """
    Make a function that prints the "raindrop" sequence for custom numbers.

    Given positive integers pling, plang, and plong, return a function that
    prints the "raindrop" sequence using those numbers. Specifically, the
    returned function should take a postiive integer num, and for 1 to num
    inclusive, print the number if not divisible by pling, plang, or plong. If
    the number is divisible by any of those integers, instead print "Pling",
    "Plang", or "Plong", combining the strings if a number is divisible by
    multiple of these integers.

    Args:
        pling: A positive int representing the number used to print "Pling".
        plang: A positive int representing the number used to print "Plang".
        plong: A positive int representing the number used to print "Plong".

    Returns:
        A function that takes an integer and prints the "raindrop" sequence
        described above.
