        "\n",
        "Before you begin work on **any** assignment, you should make sure that your\n",
        "repository is up to date. Failure to do this may result in Git errors that are\n",

        "\n",
        "To do this, go to your command line and use the `cd` command to navigate to your\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
