# Software Design (Open Version)

This repository contains the material for all assignments, worksheets, and
projects used in the Software Design (SoftDes) course at Olin College. This
includes the writeups, starter files, and rubrics.

The materials are intended to be used in conjunction with the SoftDes website at
https://softdes.olin.edu. You are expected to have followed the computational
setup instructions there (if on Windows), or to have a suitably equivalent
setup for writing and running Python code. The assignments and worksheets are
numbered to match with the readings on the SoftDes website.

The project writeups are on the SoftDes website, with the rubrics provided in
the `projects/` directory here.
